# Richest Algorithm

This Java program implements the "Richest" algorithm, which efficiently finds and maintains the 10,000 richest elements from a potentially large list of numbers. It uses a min-heap data structure to track and update the richest elements in an optimal way.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command
3. Compile the Java source code using the following command:

javac Richest.java

4. Create a text file with a list of numbers. The first 10,000 numbers will be used to initialize the richest elements.
5. Run the program with the input text file as a command-line argument:

java Richest input_file.txt

6. The program will process the input file, find the 10,000 richest elements, and write the result to a file named "richest.output."

## Output
The program will create a file named "richest.output" that contains the 10,000 richest elements in descending order, one per line.

## About the Richest Algorithm
The "Richest" algorithm maintains a min-heap data structure to efficiently track and update the 10,000 richest elements. The initial 10,000 elements are sorted using heap sort, and then the algorithm iterates through the remaining numbers, keeping the heap updated with the richest elements. This approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n log k), where n is the total number of elements and k is the number of richest elements to maintain.
